    crm:P129_is_about <http://americanartcollaborative.org/puam/person-institution/127> ;
    crm:P3_has_note """Japanese painter, performance artist and film maker active in the USA. He studied medicine and mathematics at Tokyo University (1954–8) and art at the Musashino College of Art in Tokyo, holding his first one-man exhibition at the National Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo in 1958 and contributing to the Yomiuri Independent exhibitions from 1958 to 1961. In 1960 he took part in the ‘anti-art’ activities of the Neo-dadaism organizers in Tokyo and produced his first Happenings and a series of sculptures entitled Boxes, which consisted of amorphous lumps of cotton wads hardened in cement; many of these were put in coffin-like boxes, though one entitled Foetus was laid on a blanket. In pointing to the sickness of contemporary society, these works caused a great scandal in Tokyo.\r
\r
In 1961 Arakawa settled in New York, where soon afterwards he addressed himself to the idea of a work being ‘untitled’. In taking as his subject this apparent lack of subject, he emphasized the areas of the picture surface where the subject ‘ought to be’ by means of a few well-placed coloured framing marks, as in Untitledness No. 2 (1961–2; see 1979 exh. cat., pl. 1). These were followed by another series of paintings entitled Diagrams, which consist of the sprayed silhouettes of banal objects such as tennis- rackets, combs and gloves (e.g. A Card Becomes a Foot, 1964; see 1979 exh. cat., pl. 7). After thus alluding to the shadows cast by objects, he moved even further away from actual objects by replacing them with their names and cursory outlines, as in Alphabet Skin No. 2 (1966; see 1979 exh. cat., pl. 23). Characteristically this work incorporates a ‘mistake’ in the scrubbing out of one label and its replacement with the correct word with which to identify it. This laying bare of mistakes and second thoughts as a recurrent feature of his paintings underlines the fact that he conceives of them as visualizations of thought processes, and it acts as a reminder that any interpretation might be erroneous. Arakawa continued to explore the interrelationship between different forms of representation in a series of drawings and paintings entitled Webster’s Dictionary (1965–6; see 1979 exh. cat., pls 13, 14 and 18), in which reproductions of dictionary pages were altered so that only the initial word was legible. The definitions were scribbled out in various colours, paradoxically suggesting both that words were meaningless and also that they might have an equivalent in colour.\r
\r
Many of Arakawa’s works from 1963 to 1971 formed part of The Mechanism of Meaning, a series made in collaboration with the American poet Madeline H. Gins (b 1943). A set of reproductions of these works with short captions was published in book form in 1971: divided into 16 subsections, with titles such as ‘The Energy of Meaning’ and ‘Degrees of Meaning’, this was Arakawa’s most concentrated treatment of the nature of thought, language and representation. Real objects and stencilled texts were incorporated in some works of this period, often suggesting that the viewer engage in an apparently nonsensical activity; one instruction, for instance, found beneath a piece of cloth attached to the canvas, demands: ‘Before lifting this decide whether you have ever seen what is underneath.’ Arakawa also experimented with film making during this period, producing Why Not in 1969 and For Example (A Critique of Never) in 1971. Soon after The Mechanism of Meaning his paintings settled into a more consistent style characterized by intricate networks of lines, stencilled words and pale, transparent colours. These have the rational look of technical drawings and, like his previous works, defy complete understanding, as in the diptych Afternoon and Evening (1974; see 1979 exh. cat., pls 43–4), which on the afternoon panel contains the faint words: ‘the afternoon of/each cleaving air/every air of cleaving/on the same afternoon/of “to cleave”/shape as “a nothing”/or shape in nothing’. After producing other works, sometimes very large in scale, in a similar style, in the late 1970s and early 1980s he again investigated the idea of blankness, this time by using arrows and fragments of street maps, as in Blank Dots (1982; New York, Met.) (GDA).""".

    crm:P3_has_note """John James Audubon (1785-1851) was not the first person to attempt to paint and describe all the birds of America (Alexander Wilson has that distinction), but for half a century he was the young country’s dominant wildlife artist. His seminal Birds of America, a collection of 435 life-size prints, quickly eclipsed Wilson’s work and is still a standard against which 20th and 21st century bird artists, such as Roger Tory Peterson and David Sibley, are measured. \r
\r
Although Audubon had no role in the organization that bears his name, there is a connection: George Bird Grinnell, one of the founders of the early Audubon Society in the late 1800s, was tutored by Lucy Audubon, John James’s widow. Knowing Audubon’s reputation, Grinnell chose his name as the inspiration for the organization’s earliest work to protect birds and their habitats. Today, the name Audubon remains synonymous with birds and bird conservation the world over. \r
\r
Audubon was born in Saint Domingue (now Haiti), the illegitimate son of a French sea captain and plantation owner and his French mistress. Early on, he was raised by his stepmother, Mrs. Audubon, in Nantes, France, and took a lively interest in birds, nature, drawing, and music. In 1803, at the age of 18, he was sent to America, in part to escape conscription into the Emperor Napoleon’s army. He lived on the family-owned estate at Mill Grove, near Philadelphia, where he hunted, studied and drew birds, and met his wife, Lucy Bakewell. While there, he conducted the first known bird-banding experiment in North America, tying strings around the legs of Eastern Phoebes; he learned that the birds returned to the very same nesting sites each year. \r
\r
Audubon spent more than a decade in business, eventually traveling down the Ohio River to western Kentucky – then the frontier – and setting up a dry-goods store in Henderson. He continued to draw birds as a hobby, amassing an impressive portfolio. While in Kentucky, Lucy gave birth to two sons, Victor Gifford and John Woodhouse, as well as a daughter who died in infancy. Audubon was quite successful in business for a while, but hard times hit, and in 1819 he was briefly jailed for bankruptcy. \r
\r
With no other prospects, Audubon set off on his epic quest to depict America’s avifauna, with nothing but his gun, artist’s materials, and a young assistant. Floating down the Mississippi, he lived a rugged hand-to-mouth existence in the South while Lucy earned money as a tutor to wealthy plantation families. In 1826 he sailed with his partly finished collection to England. "The American Woodsman" was literally an overnight success. His life-size, highly dramatic bird portraits, along with his embellished descriptions of wilderness life, hit just the right note at the height of the Continent’s Romantic era. Audubon found a printer for the Birds of America, first in Edinburgh, then London, and later collaborated with the Scottish ornithologist William MacGillivray on the Ornithological Biographies – life histories of each of the species in the work. \r
\r
The last print was issued in 1838, by which time Audubon had achieved fame and a modest degree of comfort, traveled this country several more times in search of birds, and settled in New York City. He made one more trip out West in 1843, the basis for his final work of mammals, the Viviparous Quadrupeds of North America, which was largely completed by his sons and the text of which was written by his long-time friend, the Lutheran pastor John Bachman (whose daughters married Audubon’s sons). Audubon spent his last years in senility and died at age 65. He is buried in the Trinity Cemetery at 155th Street and Broadway in New York City. \r
\r
Audubon’s story is one of triumph over adversity; his accomplishment is destined for the ages. He encapsulates the spirit of young America, when the wilderness was limitless and beguiling. He was a person of legendary strength and endurance as well as a keen observer of birds and nature. Like his peers, he was an avid hunter, and he also had a deep appreciation and concern for conservation; in his later writings he sounded the alarm about destruction of birds and habitats. It is fitting that today we carry his name and legacy into the future. \r

From 1950 he also contributed photographs to Life, Look and Graphis and in 1952 became Staff Editor and photographer for Theatre Arts. Towards the end of the 1950s he became dissatisfied with daylight photography and open air locations and so turned to studio photography, using strobe lighting. In 1965 he left Harper’s Bazaar to work for Vogue under Diana Vreeland and Alexander Liberman. Avedon presented fashion photography as theatre, and his innovative style greatly influenced other photographers; his work of the 1960s hinted at the energy and sexual explicitness of the period.\r
\r
Concurrent with his commercial assignments, Avedon produced portrait photographs of both celebrities and ordinary Americans. In his book Nothing Personal (1964), which includes portraits of figures such as the philosopher Bertrand Russell together with images of prisoners, the mentally ill and the poor, he created a disturbingly contrasting picture of society. In 1976 he photographed American businessmen and political leaders for a portfolio in Rolling Stone. His portraits, made with a view camera and often printed larger than life, are stark images with plain white backdrops, with the sitter generally looking directly at the camera. The unflinching quality of such works is especially evident in a series of portraits of his dying father exhibited in 1974 at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. He adapted this style for In the American West, a series of portraits produced from 1979 to 1984 for the Amon Carter Museum in Fort Worth, TX. The harsh realism of these portraits of miners, oil workers and slaughter house workers provides a powerful, if bleak, record of working life in the region. A major retrospective exhibition of Avedon’s photographs was mounted in 1994 at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York (GDA).""".

She first used the medium of drypoint but by the late 1920s was using lithography, etching and pastel in her satirical works.

\r
Oscar Bailey earned a B.A. in art from Wilmington College in Ohio in 1951 and shortly thereafter went to work for a commercial printer in Delaware, Ohio. When the shop obtained a copy camera, Bailey asked to work with it. His interest in photography grew, and soon he bought his own camera - the best he could get for a full week's pay. Bailey taught himself how to use a camera, and after three or four years, he decided to make photography his career. He enrolled in the MFA program at Ohio University, graduating in 1958 with a degree in photography. Bailey was professor of photography at State University College in Buffalo, New York, from 1958 until 1969 and left to start the photography program at the University of South Florida, where he was a professor until he retired in 1985. Bailey came to U.S.F. when the first phase of Graphicstudio was just beginning, and he became an active participant in the program, ontributing his photographic expertise to a number of projects, including those of James Rosenquist and Robert Rauchenberg. Bailey was selected by Minor White for inclusion in two issues of the important magazine Aperture in 1959 and 1961.\r
\r
In 1962 Bailey became a founding member of the Society for Photographic Education. In addition to his tenure at U.S.F., his teaching activities have included visiting artist appointments at the Penland School of Crafts in North Carolina (1971, 1973, 1979) as well as artist-in-residence at ArtPark in Lewiston, New York (1977). In 1972 Bailey supervised the publication of the book, Silver Bullets, a collection of photographs by U.S.F. art students.\r
\r
One-man exibitions of his work have been organized by Indiana University (1960), Kalamazoo Institute of Arts, Michigan (1963), Ohio Wesleyan University (1964), International Museum of Photography, George Eastman House, Rochester, New York (1964), University of Oregon, Eugene (1969), University of South Florida, Tampa (1972, 1974), University of Colorado, Boulder (1976), Southern Illinois University, Carbondale (1977), University of North Florida, Jacksonville (1978) and the Lynch Gallery, St. Petersburg, Florida (1981).\r

    crm:P3_has_note "American conceptual artist. After studying art at San Diego State College (1949–57), he began to develop his painting style, soon incorporating letters, words and photographs in his works. By 1966 he was using photographs and text, or simply text, on canvas as in Semi-close-up of Girl by Geranium … (1966–8; Basle, Kstmus.). From 1970 he worked in printmaking, film, video, installation, sculpture and photography. His work is characterized by a consciousness of language evident in his use of puns, semantics based on the structuralism of Claude Lévi-Strauss and by the incorporation of material drawn from popular culture. Both are apparent in Blasted Allegories (1978; New York, Sonnabend Gal.), a series combining polaroids of television images captioned and arranged to suggest an unusual syntax. Baldessari differed from other conceptual artists in his humour and commitment to the visual image. He dramatized the ordinary, although beneath the apparent simplicity of his words and images lie multiple connotations (GDA)." .

    crm:P3_has_note """At its core, Jerrold Ballaine’s recent work is about contradictions.  At once, it denotes motion and stasis, engagement and neutrality, impermanence and monumentality, beauty and rawness.  It is also contradictory in its use of materials.\r
 \r
The artist has long painted like a sculptor; he now sculpts like a painter.  For Ballaine, such dichotomies parallel and define his career, which has evolved over fifty years from a Bay Area figurative artist, to a sculptor of vacuum-formed plastics, to a landscapist, to a figure painter, and now to a stone sculptor.  Throughout these diverse styles, his aim has been to evolve naturally and steadily and never to become pigeonholed by a particular style, following artistic paths even when they might not be commercially viable.  There is, however, one constant that runs throughout Ballaine’s work—he has never relinquished his adherence to representational subject matter or the technical side of creation.  “I’m old fashioned,” the artist admits.  “I am an object maker.”   \r
\r
In Ballaine’s hands, two- and three-dimensional media have more commonalities than differences.  Even in his earliest paintings, Ballaine sculpted.  Having studied under Richard Diebenkorn at the San Francisco Art Institute in 1960-61, an artist and teacher that Ballaine acknowledges as his most profound artistic influence, he started out as a Bay Area Figurative painter.  He came to the San Francisco Bay Area after studying business at the University of Washington and serving in the military in Germany for two years.  He then attended the Art Center School in Los Angeles.  At the San Francisco Art Institute, he began to paint representational works with the vivid palette and loaded brush of an Abstract Expressionist.  These early paintings, which depicted landscape and/or the human figure, were composed of such thickly layered, luscious paint that they literally became sculptural reliefs.  Coming as close to pure abstraction as Ballaine ever cared to get, the canvases were slathered with pigment acquired from Bay City Paint, whose exceptionally reasonable prices induced a veritable “school” of San Francisco artists to embrace thick, viscous paint application.  “Everyone was using Bay City Paint,” Ballaine remembers, including Jay DeFeo, Jim Weeks, and Ballaine’s one-time studio-mate, Joan Brown.  Even today, Ballaine admits to being “in love” with brushwork, although his acrylic canvases are now considerably smoother than were these early oils.   \r
\r
 Since the early 1970s, Ballaine has used acrylic.  Although Ballaine now applies paint more smoothly than in his early oils, he still models his figures as would a sculptor, carving and defining their forms in space.  For the artist, these figurative paintings represent his coming full circle, hearkening back to his early influences and inspirations as a student at the Art Institute.  The figures in his canvases writhe and twist, pushing beyond the very limits of their humanity to become essays in movement and pure form.  To be sure, the figures are rendered expressionistically, but the artist is quick to point out that he is more interested in motion and positions than psychology or sexuality.  He sees these paintings as having more in common with the aims of artists such as the Italian Futurists than the distorted and violent emotional expressionism of an artist such as the British artist Francis Bacon.  The emotional intensity of Ballaine’s paintings stems not then from psychological engagement, but from brushwork and the organic, fluid qualities of the human form.  He intentionally obscures faces and genitals, areas of the body that best communicate psychology and menace in order to focus attention on more neutral states of the figure in arrested motion. \r
\r
 It is also intentional that Ballaine’s forms assume poses not always possible in reality.  In creating his paintings, he starts with a model, first taking photographs of the sitter and then making drawings from the photos.  His paintings are then created from the drawings.  Each incarnation is a step away from his original source and results in imagery that is increasingly removed from reality.  What are left are raw abstractions of humans that are so fluid and nebulous that they seem almost devoid of skeletal systems.  In many cases, Ballaine uses no tangible source for his work, relying completely on memory, further enhancing the dreamlike quality of his work. \r
\r
 The environments that Ballaine’s abstract figures inhabit are nearly as expressive as the figures themselves and are rich in variety.  Soft-edged fields of color float hazily in atmospheric layers.  Medium-width bands appear abraded, dragged, and scrubbed, and dark lines are sharp and distinct, defining corners and the edges of walls.  So carefully composed and energized are these backgrounds that they could in fact function as completed paintings in themselves, even without the figures.  As such, they would belie Diebenkorn’s enduring influence, particularly his Ocean Park landscapes, for not only do Ballaine’s backgrounds ground the figures in an interior space, they in fact seem equally derived from the California landscape.  Since early in his career, Ballaine has found in Diebenkorn’s compositions a logic that appeals to his intellect.  He seems to have picked up his instructor’s methods “almost instinctively.”   \r
\r
 At the same time that Ballaine produced his most recent series of paintings, he also began to capture the human figure in stone.  Although he has been making sculpture—in both plastic and clay—since the 1960s, Ballaine turned to marble only recently.  He was initially inspired to try his hand at stone carving because of an extended trip to Egypt in 1995.  It was not, however, until the summer of 2004, when he went to work with his friend and fellow sculptor Manuel Neri in Carrera, Italy, that he began to pursue this new path.  What resulted was a series of sculptures that share a strong relationship with the paintings, although with greater permanence.  Overtly contemporary in their abstract representation of the human form, the figures still manage to communicate some of the timelessness, strength, and mystery present in representations of ancient pharaohs.  While Ballaine’s sculptures do not share the heroicizing stasis of Egyptian prototypes, they do capture their monumentality and grandeur.   \r
\r
 Like the figures in his paintings, the bodies in Ballaine’s sculptures, which are almost all female, seem to be caught between poses.  They are organic, twisting and turning, and ultimately captured for eternity in the act of gesture.  In their subtlety they may seem far removed from the brightly colored paintings, yet in both, forms emerge and dissolve, becoming sharp and then indistinct.  Akin to the paintings, the sculptures’ faces, limbs, and sexual anatomy are either obscured or removed altogether, and the human form offers only a superficial adherence to human anatomy.  Psychology, emotion, and personality become secondary to an abstracted human shell.\r
\r
 In these sculptures, as in much of his other work, the artist is seduced by his materials.  He uses a variety of types of stone, some ordered from abroad and others quarried in California.  “Terrified” of pure white marble, Ballaine most often uses heavily veined stone, exploiting the natural irregularities to dictate the basis for the figure that lies within.  For him, the stone is like a “fabric” that dresses his figures.  In some instances, he enhances the natural colors of the stone with permanent stains.  These blend seamlessly with the existing veins to blur where Ballaine leaves off and nature begins.  Staining also helps the artist to articulate and define his forms in much the same way that he “sculpts” them on canvas.  In finishing the figures, he is careful not to over polish them, which he feels might take away from their seriousness of purpose and make them too “decorative.” \r
\r
 Here too, however, the artist exploits contradiction.  The gravity of the work and the hardness of the stone compete with the subtle beauty and seduction of sugar-like marble and soft, sensuous veining that begs to be caressed.  As in the paintings, the beauty of the objects themselves lures the viewer in and then the apparent disregard for the sanctity of the human form, as well as the figures’ emotional detachment, is more directly confrontational and challenging.  What results is the seductive, repellant, and captivating push and pull of engagement.\r

She then trained as a sculptor at Columbia University, New York, receiving her MFA in 1972. Her first performance, in which ‘music’ was played on car horns, took place in 1972 at Town Green in Rochester, NY. She continued to work primarily as a performance artist, using photographs, films, projected texts and, above all, music to create sophisticated and precisely staged events. The most complex and spectacular of these, United States, first performed in full at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York in 1983, was a four-part compendium of spoken texts and songs in which she addressed themes that she continued to explore in her later work, notably the use and abuse of language and of political power in its many forms (GDA)." .
